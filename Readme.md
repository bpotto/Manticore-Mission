(This is a rudimentary, text-based RPG, built mostly for programming practice, though maybe you'll have some fun with it too...eventually.)

Manticore Mission is a game about massacring monsters in the monarchdom of Mata'a, a world of alliteration and adventure.
The kingdom is ravaged by the dreaded Manticore, who abides in a Castle.  Villages are destroyed, money is worthless, and everyone merely strives to survive.
Based in a dilapidated shack outside the Castle, your goal is to gain the strength to defeat the dreaded Manticore and save Mata'a.

The game is very, **VERY** basic now (playable and, if you grind far too long or are very very lucky, winnable), but there are ideas for future updates:

1. An equipment system
2. More numerous enemy and power types
3. Scripted encounters
4. A merchant system based on bartering
5. New levels after defeating the Manticore
6. Packaged as EXE
7. Possibly--with much more work and learning--a graphic version
